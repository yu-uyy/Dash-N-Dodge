Step 2: Install git.  
Step 3: Git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git to a local directory.  
Step 4: Navigate inside the dir by ```cd .\vcpkg ```  
Step 5: Run the bootstrap script to build vcpkg 
```.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat ```  
Step 6: Integrate vcpkg with visualstudio2022
```.\vcpkg integrate install ```  
Step 7: Now you can finally start installing projects with vcpkg
```.\vcpkg install sfml```
